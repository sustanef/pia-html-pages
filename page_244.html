measurement equipment at a possible measurement point impractical or

uneconomic in the opinion of the Commission, the Commission may approve

procedures for determining the chargeable volumes at a deemed

measurement point in the field based on measurements at the point of sale,

export terminal or other point downstream of such deemed measurement

point under the regulations or guidelines and the measurement of crude oil,

condensates and natural gas liquids shall be in barrels and of natural gas in

standard cubic feet and where so justified, the Commission may approve

reporting of production of natural gas liquids in metric tons.
