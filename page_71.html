(5) Notwithstanding any grant of a petroleum mining lease under
subsection (4), the applicable petroleum prospecting licence shall continue for

the remaining area to which that licence relates for the duration provided for

in that licence.
(6)  The area to which a petroleum mining lease relates and derived
from a petroleum prospecting licence shall be proposed by the licensee, based

on an independent engineering report, which shall not be binding on the

Commission.
(7)  The Commission shall approve the proposed area, which shall contain
every parcel within the outer boundary of the field based on oil-water contacts,

spill point, intersection of planned development wells with the reservoirs or

other reservoir limits, including a zone surrounding the boundary consisting of

all parcels that are in whole or in part within one kilometre of such outer

boundary, provided that such area shall not contain parcelsŠ
(
a
) outside the original licence area from which the lease is derived ;
(
b
) in areas relinquished by the licensee ; or
(
c
) in an existing petroleum mining lease.
(8)  The Commission may approve modification of an area of a petroleum
mining lease to include further parcels as are appropriate, based on the criteria

prescribed under subsections (6) and (7), where during the period provided

for in a petroleum prospecting licence, the outer boundary of the commercial

discovery changes due to furtherŠ
(
a
) drilling or other exploration activities ; or
(
b
) petroleum discoveries in deeper or shallower formations.
(9)  Where two or more petroleum mining leases derived from the
same petroleum prospecting licence constitute a single field based on an

interpretation by the Commission of geological or petroleum engineering

data showing that the field is a single field, the leases shall be considered

as a single lease, notwithstanding that their boundaries do not join with

another lease, provided the granting date of the single lease shall be the

date of the first lease that was granted.
(10) A petroleum mining lease shall not consist of an area that is less
than one parcel or where a parcel has been subdivided under section 69 (5) of

thisAct, less than one subdivision of such parcel.
(11)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a petroleum mining
lease may also be granted under sections 74 (3) and 93 of this Act.
