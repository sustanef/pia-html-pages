netback value at the measurement point based on the composition of the natural

gas in terms of marketable natural gas, ethane, propane, butane, pentanes and

other natural gas liquids as may be derived by processing of the natural gas

and the net back procedure shall take into consideration the type of natural

gas markets to which the natural gas from the field is being sold, such as

export markets, domestic wholesale markets, markets based on the aggregate

gas price or other natural gas pricing framework as permitted under this Act

and the procedure shall take into consideration conditioning costs, processing

costs and transportation costs within Nigeria as determined by the Authority

from the measurement point to the market, where the sales point is downstream

of the measurement point, and where natural gas liquids are produced in the

field, the total gross value of the liquids shall be taken into account in the

determination of the total gross value of the natural gas for the purpose of the

fiscal gas price.
