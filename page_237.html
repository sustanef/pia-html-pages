Value of an asset or interest in a petroleum prospecting
licence or petroleum mining lease
11.Š(1)  The value of an asset or interest in a petroleum prospecting
licence or petroleum mining lease at the date of its disposal shall be the net

proceeds of the sale or of the relevant interest, or, where it was disposed of

without being sold, the amount which, in the opinion of the service, the asset

or the relevant interest, as the case may be, would have fetched if sold in the

open market at that date, less the amount of any expenses which the owner

might reasonably be expected to incur if the asset were so sold.

the circumstances that insurance or compensation money are received by the

owner, the asset or the relevant interest, as the case may be, shall be treated

as having been sold and as though the net proceeds of the insurance or

compensation money were the net proceeds of the sale.
