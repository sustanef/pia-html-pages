(3) Where natural gas liquids are extracted in a gas processing plant
downstream of the measurement point, the rich natural gas volumes, still

including the natural gas liquids, shall be measured at the measurement point

and be the basis for royalty calculations and the value of such rich natural gas

shall be the value of the marketable natural gas plus the natural gas liquids at

the exit of the gas processing plant, less the gas processing costs and less the

transport cost between the measurement point and the gas processing plant

based on tariffs established by the Authority.
(4) Natural gas liquids and liquid petroleum gases shall have the same
royalty rates as the natural gas from which these products are derived.
(5)  The chargeable volume shall be measured at standard temperatures
and pressures as defined by regulation or guidelines and production shall not

include anyŠ
(
a
) volumes burned, flared or vented with the approval of the Commission;
(
b
) volumes re-injected by the lessee into reservoirs for the purpose of

Determination of price for royalty
8.Š(1) The royalties applicable to crude oil and condensates shall be
based on the fiscal oil price determined for the field at the measurement

points under applicable regulations or guidelines, and this price shall be

determined by the Commission on the basis of information supplied by the

lessees and from non-confidential independent publications, making such

adjustments for quality and transport costs as appropriate to prices of

comparable crude oils and condensates sold in the international market, as

determined by the Commission, for which appropriate information is

available and with the objective to approximate as reasonably as possible

the average fair market value of the month of the crude oil and condensates

for such month for such field.
